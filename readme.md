# Trolley Problems
## A eulogy for social norms

---

- distinct scenarios around ambiguous social norms
    - do you ask a stranger to get up to let you go to the bathroom or ask four of your friends?
    - when you walk past theater seats, do you use your butt or your crotch? (assume you are a man)
    - handshake vs hug when saying goodbye to a new acquaintance?
    - do you ghost or break it off cleanly?
    - the trendy trolley problem: you're a self-driving car, do you kill your passenger or the person in the street?
- track the decisions everyone makes, at the end, show how you compare

some various notes:

- faceless human-ish entities
- "friends" can all be green or blue, "strangers" can all be red
- don't limit to the physical world! include ambiguity of digital social norms as well!
- don't limit it to humans! machines make decisions according to the norms of their creators!

questions:

- are the scenarios connected? as in, do they form a cohesive narrative? or are they all isolated?
    - if they're isolated, there's more room to play with different roles. e.g. you could be a self-driving car in one.
    - but, even if you play different characters, they can still be linked in a multi-protagonist narrative...
