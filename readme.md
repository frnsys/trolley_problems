# Trolley Problems
## A eulogy for social norms

---

- distinct scenarios around ambiguous social norms
    - do you ask a stranger to get up to let you go to the bathroom or ask four of your friends?
    - when you walk past theater seats, do you use your butt or your crotch? (assume you are a man)
    - handshake vs hug when saying goodbye to a new acquaintance?
    - do you ghost or break it off cleanly?
    - the trendy trolley problem: you're a self-driving car, do you kill your passenger or the person in the street?
    - you’re in a collision course with someone on the sidewalk, do you scoot left or right?, what if they maove in front of you again? (Eduoard)
    - do you try to squeeze in to the subway car or take the chance of waiting for the next one, which might not come anytime soon. it always feels lose lose to me (Morgane)
    - when sharing snacks with someone, do you take the last morsel for yourself or politely avoid it and let them have it (Morgane)
    - do you go to work knowing that you’re a meaningless cog in the capitalist machine or reject the system and realize you can never succeed that way (Morgane)
- track the decisions everyone makes, at the end, show how you compare

some various notes:

- faceless human-ish entities
- "friends" can all be green or blue, "strangers" can all be red
- don't limit to the physical world! include ambiguity of digital social norms as well!
- don't limit it to humans! machines make decisions according to the norms of their creators!

questions:

- are the scenarios connected? as in, do they form a cohesive narrative? or are they all isolated?
    - if they're isolated, there's more room to play with different roles. e.g. you could be a self-driving car in one.
        - "you get turned into a self-driving car"
    - but, even if you play different characters, they can still be linked in a multi-protagonist narrative...
- or, the twist could be that it's a training simulator for self-driving car AIs; at the end you are only released onto market if you conform to the majority norms
